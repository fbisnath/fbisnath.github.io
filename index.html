                <p>I am a fifth-year PhD student of linguistics at the <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/linguistics">University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</a> advised by <a href="http://savi.ling.lsa.umich.edu/">Dr. Savithry Namboodiripad</a>, working with the <a href="https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/ccc-lab/home?authuser=0">Contact, Cognition and Change Lab</a> and the <i>Cognition, Convergence and Language Evolution</i> research group.</p>
                <p>I am a contact linguist investigating cross-modal language contact in sign languages and its attitudinal and experiential correlates using a mix of experimental and survey tools, and quantitative and qualitative analysis. My research is guided by the study of marginalised phenomena and languages, marginalisation in linguistics, and a goal of capturing cross-linguistic and individual variation. I draw on anthropology, social science, and cognitive science, bringing together Creole linguistics, sign language linguistics, psycholinguistics, and sociolinguistics.</p>
                <p>My current research interests are in language attitudes and multimodal language contact, specifically mouthing in sign languages. My dissertation characterises experience with American Sign Language (ASL) and English in deaf and hard-of-hearing signers, captures differences in attitude to ASL while modulating the quantity of mouthing, and models how perceiver socialisation correlates with differences in attitudes to signing and signers. This is achieved using survey and experimental methods, multivariate statistical analysis, and regression modeling.</p>
                <p>A practical implementation of my work is collaborative efforts within the University of Michigan's Linguistics department on incorporating minoritised languages in undergraduate linguistics classrooms, specifically Creoles and signed languages.</p>

                        <p>This line of research explores attitudes towards American Sign Language (ASL) and its contact with English, particularly in the context of bilingual deaf and hard-of-hearing communities. I investigate how mouthing (the visible movements of the mouth that accompany sign language) is perceived and how these attitudes are shaped by social factors.</p>
