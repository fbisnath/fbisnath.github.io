From 2024 to 2026, I will investigate iconicity of depicting signs in Norwegian Sign Language experimentally and with corpus data, and perception of Norwegian mouthing in Norwegian Sign Language. I did my PhD at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor where I investigated the attitudes of deaf and hard-of-hearing signers of ASL in the United States to English mouthing experimentally, and explored emergent means of categorising signers based on their self-reported experiences with English, ASL and ASL-English mixing.\nFind more recent activities in Updates.\n\n\nContact\nEmail me at felicia.bisnath at hvl dot no"
